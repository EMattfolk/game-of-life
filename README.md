 # Game of life
 This is a recreation of Conway's Game of Life made in Java.

 ## Features
 * Scalable field
 * Saving of cell configurations
 * Fast simulation up to 200 updates per second

## Rules:
* Tile is _**born**_ if it has ```3``` neighbors
* Tile _**dies**_ if it has less than ```2``` neighbors or greater than ```3``` neighbors

## Controls:
* Switch mode:               Shift
* Start/Stop simulation:     Space
* Clear board:               C
* In Tilemode (Default)
* Create life:               Left click  (hold and drag to create more)
* Kill life:                 Right click (hold and drag to kill more)
* Change simulation speed:   Right/Left arrow key
* Simulate one generation:   Up arrow key
*
* In Shapemode
* Save shapes:               Mark area using Right mouse button
* Place shapes:              Left click
* Rotate shapes:             Up arrow key
* Delete shapes:             D

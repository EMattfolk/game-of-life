 # Game of life
 This is a recreation of Conway's Game of Life made in Java.

 ## Features
 * Saving of cell configurations
 * Simulation as fast as your computer can handle

## Rules
* Tile is _**born**_ if it has **3** neighbors
* Tile _**dies**_ if it has less than **2** neighbors or greater than **3** neighbors
